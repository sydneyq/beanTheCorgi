# Bean the Corgi

Bean the Corgi is a bot made with Python 3.7 and the discord.py wrapper.

This bot was made specifically for the Mind Café server, which aims to be a mental health support space.

## Testing

Because this bot was made for a specific server and functionality in mind, you may have to swap some IDs around for personal testing.

Create your own file named `secret.py`; this should hold the `BOT_TOKEN` and your own `BOT_OWNER_ID`.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome for those who understand the already-existing code. Please be sure to thoroughly explain your changes.
